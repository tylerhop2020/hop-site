                <h4>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h4>
                <p>In Short:  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at team@hopnightlife.com. The app sign up process requires that each user affirm they are 21, however, it is the responsibility of the venue to ensure that all entrants are of legal age. Whilst we try to ensure that each user is 21, it is not against our policy to have an account as a person of 18 years of age or older. We want to be clear – Hop does not condone underage drinking in any country, however, Hop is not responsible for the age of entrants to a Venue. That responsibility remains with the venue.</p>
